            <h2> About Sean </h2>
            <p> My professional background is in food & beverage/hospitality with a specialization
              in the coffee supply chain. With 15 years of experience, the peak of my career was running 3 restauants and
              managing a team of 75. My educational background is in religious studies, which is still a very important
              and fascinating subject to me that I contiue to research independently. I am currently working on a master's
              thesis on the topic of digitally native religious movements.</p>
            <p> I am currently a student of the Thinkful Software Engineering Bootcamp, and I could not be happier with the
              program or the prospects of the industry. Web development has be one of the most fulfilling endeavors of my life
              and I an encouraged by how much room there is to learn and grow personally.</p>
            <p> The most rewarding aspect of this experience thus far has been the community of devlopers that I have had the pleasure
              of working beside. If you are looking for an enthusiastic member to join your project, nothing would make me happier
              than to build new friendships while building a new future for the world. </p>
